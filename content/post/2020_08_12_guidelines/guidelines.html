<p>Today we have a guest entry authored by <a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014ReKQAA0/rochelle-tractenberg">Rochelle Tractenberg</a> (Georgetown University) about integrating ethics training into any quantitative course. She writes:</p>
<p>This blog post focuses on encouraging instructors to use structure
in order to facilitate the integration of ethics training into their
courses. In particular, five structural features are briefly introduced.</p>
<p>Instructors can use <strong>professional ethical
practice standards</strong>, <em>not issues</em>, <strong>to guide instruction/learning
objectives</strong>.</p>
<p>This assumes (or, also encourages) the use of <strong>instructional
and/or curriculum development guidelines</strong>–all of which will place
the articulation of realistic and meaningful learning outcomes in
the primary decision making position–such that all later instructional
decisions follow from the learning objectives. Using issues, instead
of practice standards, makes the articulation of learning objectives
difficult; it can also lead to the incorrect perception that it is
issue resolution, and not ethical practice, that is the purpose of
the training. These suggestions are motivated by (and explicated
in) a new white paper, “Ten simple rules for integrating ethics
into statistics and data science instruction” (<a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z9uej">Tractenberg, 2020</a>).</p>
<p>Two other resources can also provide helpful structure: an outline
of <strong>stakeholder analysis</strong>, which can be used to orient students to
harms and benefits associated with decisions that they make throughout
the process of data analysis; and the <strong>knowledge, skills, and abilities
of ethical reasoning</strong> (which utilize professional practice standards
and stakeholder analysis in order to support defendable decisions
about ethical practice or in cases of ethical challenges or dilemmas).
Finally, considerations of seven tasks that all statistics and data
science can/do follow/recognize means that the integration effort
will <strong>leverage–and accommodate–the complexities of practice</strong>.
This means that, rather than adding “ethics content”, instructors
can truly integrate ethics training as they engage students with
authentic, practice-based, approaches to using statistics and data
science methods ethically and responding to ethical challenges as
they arise throughout their careers.</p>

<h3>Practice Standards</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/Ethical-Guidelines-for-Statistical-Practice.aspx">ASA Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice</a> include 52 items under eight general areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Professional Integrity &amp; Accountability (7)</li>
<li>B. Integrity of data and methods (11)</li>
<li>C. Responsibilities to Science/Public/Funder/Client (5)</li>
<li>D. Responsibilities to Research Subjects (7)</li>
<li>E. Responsibilities to Research Team Colleagues (4)</li>
<li>F. Responsibilities to Other Statisticians or Statistics Practitioners (4)</li>
<li>G. Responsibilities Regarding Allegations of Misconduct (6)</li>
<li>H. Responsibilities of Employers/Clients Employing Statistical Practitioners (8)</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>In one sense, this means there are 52 different ways to add ethics
content to your course. In another sense, this means that the ethics
content really cannot be memorized – because it is a lot to remember;
fortunately, “memorize the ASA Ethical Guidelines” is a weak learning
outcome that few instructors would bother to formulate – because
memorization, the lowest (least complex) cognitive behavior in
Bloom’s taxonomy (Bloom et al. 1956), does not enable the learner
to utilize what was memorized.</p>
</div>
<div id="curriculum-development-guidelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Curriculum development guidelines</h3>
<p>Integration of ethics content,
and ethical reasoning in particular, should follow established
curriculum and instructional guidelines (described and discussed in Tractenberg et al. 2020), for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Identify and follow a formal paradigm for curriculum or instructional design.</li>
<li>B. Focus on Learning Outcomes (LOs) first, to inform all other decisions about the curriculum and instruction.
<ul>
<li>B1: Leverage LOs to explore and identify appropriate learning experiences (LEs).</li>
<li>B2: Leverage LOs to select content that is appropriate for the LEs and promotes the LOs.</li>
<li>B3: Assess learning based on achievement of LOs using formative and summative assessment, as appropriate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>C: Plan and execute an actionable evaluation of the curriculum and instruction.</li>
<li>D: Document and share the features of the curriculum or instruction – including criteria for their success – with learners.</li>
</ul>
<p>As guidelines for curriculum and course development in higher
education and training will suggest, realistic and actionable
learning outcomes are essential to ensuring that the effort required
to achieve the target integration (i.e., of ethics training) is
actually effective. Moreover, if there are improvements to implement,
an actionable evaluation will help identify them.</p>

<div id="knowledge-skills-and-abilities-ksas-of-ethical-reasoning" class="section level3">
<h3>Knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) of ethical reasoning</h3>
<p>One
way to conceptualize the purposes of integrating ethical training
is to focus on preparing students to use ethical reasoning (Tractenberg
&amp; FitzGerald, 2012), because applying ethical guidelines can be
complex. Learning to reason with (i.e., utilize) professional
practice standards and stakeholder analysis will allow students to
make and support defendable decisions about ethical practice, or,
in cases of ethical challenges or dilemmas. Importantly, the ethical
practice standards can help both general practice and in identifying
and overcoming ethical challenges or dilemmas. This is lost when
instruction or training focus solely on issues. The articulation
of learning objectives can be facilitated by a focus on ethical
reasoning (i.e., on the initiation and future growth of these
specific KSAs along the pre-specified developmental trajectory
outlined by Tractenberg &amp; FitzGerald, 2012; Tractenberg et al.
2017).</p>
</div>
<div id="leverage-and-accommodate---the-complexities-of-practice." class="section level3">
<h3>Leverage – and accommodate - the complexities of practice.</h3>
<p>Since “application” of ethical practice standards is a considerably
more cognitively-complex behavior than “recalling” those standards
(Tractenberg et al. 2013), instructors should be prepared to encourage
students to move beyond memorization on Bloom’s Taxonomy of Cognitive
Behaviors (Bloom et al., 1956).</p>

</div>
<p>It is essential to recognize that Bloom’s level 4 (analysis) is required to use ethical practice standards effectively; since the ASA Ethical Guidelines are just that, guidelines, and not rules, Bloom’s level 3 (application) is not a complex-enough level of performance to aim for.
Rather than create de novo materials
for existing courses that might then appear to compete for attention
during the available time, consider seven tasks that all statistics
and data science can/do follow/recognize (Tractenberg in review A;
in review B):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>plan/design</li>
<li>collect/munge/wrangle data</li>
<li>analysis – literal for statistics &amp; data science, “evaluation” for computing</li>
<li>interpret – always for statistics &amp; data science, never for computing</li>
<li>document</li>
<li>report &amp; communicate</li>
<li>work on a team</li>
</ol>
<p>These seven tasks are essential in the practice of statistics and
data science, and the ASA Ethical Guidelines pertain in each of
these tasks. Thus, rather than adding “ethics content” to an existing
course that is presumably already “full” of content, instructors
can truly integrate ethics training as they engage students with
authentic, practice-based, approaches to using statistics and data
science methods ethically and responding to ethical challenges as
they arise throughout their careers. Again, leveraging these tasks
(and/or any of the other structural elements described here) can
help instructors to focus on learning objectives – not issues – and
to optimize existing course/teaching materials so that articulated
learning objectives - plus specific learning objectives about ethical
reasoning for statistics and data science - have the greatest chances
of being achieved.</p>

<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>This is a guest post by Rochelle Tractenberg.
Dr. Tractenberg is a tenured professor in the Department of Neurology, with secondary appointments in the Departments of Biostatistics, Bioinformatics &amp; Biomathematics and Rehabilitation Medicine at Georgetown University.
She is also a Research Fellow at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington, DC.
She is a research methodologist specializing in designs and analyses with “difficult to measure” outcomes in biomedical and educational studies, with PhDs in psychology/cognitive sciences (1997) and measurement, statistics, and evaluation (2009); she also earned a doctoral level certificate in gerontology (2006).
Her areas of interest beyond biostatistics and psychometrics include higher education curriculum development and evaluation; statistical methodology and statistical literacy for effective stewardship of the discipline in PhD students/holders; and effective instruction and mentoring in research ethics.
She was elected a Fellow of the American Statistical Association in 2016 and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2017. She was the Chair (2017-2019) of the American Statistical Association Committee on Professional Ethics, serving as Vice-Chair 2014-2016.
Internationally she is involved in educational and training initiatives that feature the curriculum development, evaluation, and revision tool she created, the Mastery Rubric (<a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qd2ae/" class="uri">https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qd2ae/</a>).
In addition to supporting effective curricula (i.e., where intended and actual learning goals are aligned), the Mastery Rubric construct is the first way to bring psychometrically-defined validity to curriculum decisions, and has supported the first-ever evidence that training in research ethics can be sustainable beyond the end of instruction (<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2227-7102/7/1/2" class="uri">http://www.mdpi.com/2227-7102/7/1/2</a>).</p>

<h3>About this blog</h3>
<p>Last summer we wrote a series of blog entries designed to start conversations around teaching data science, <a href="https://teachdatascience.com/">Teach Data Science</a>. We covered topics such as data science software, data ingestation, data technologies, data wrangling, visualization &amp; exploration, communication, and key reports and findings on data science.</p>
<p>One key element that was lacking on our 2019 blog was a discussion about and a commitment to teaching the ethical aspects of data science. We have now found ourselves in the summer of 2020, overwhelmed by the state of the world and re-committed to the ethical challenges which can help data science be a positive force for change.</p>
<p>Although none of us are experts in ethics, we have all included ethics discussions in our classrooms for many years. In the weeks to come, we will share some of the ways we engage our students in these important topics. We will provide resources for readings, examples, datasets, and exercises. We believe that data ethics are part of every data science analysis and classroom experience, and we hope that this summer’s blog will entice you into presenting ethical dilemmas and related conversations to your students early and often.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2020, we plan to write a dozen blog entries on data ethics. We’re nearly there! We hope that you bookmark the site and check in regularly. Want a reminder?
