<p>The (virtual) <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2020/">JSM 2020</a> kicks off this weekend, and as always, there are some great events on the schedule.
In this entry, we begin by enumerating some sessions that are relevant to data ethics, then close with some other sessions that we suspect may be of interest to those teaching statistics and data science courses.</p>

<h2>Other teaching related sessions</h2>
<p>On Monday at 1:00pm, Jo is chairing the <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2020/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=219492">Journal of Statistics Education</a> session where Nicole Lazar will talk about “What to Teach (And What Not to Teach) About P-Values”, I will discuss “The Role of Computing at the Core of a Modern Introductory Statistics Course”, and Kevin Cummiskey will talk about “Multivariate Thinking, Confounding and Causal Inference in Intro Stats”.</p>
<p>But there are so many really interesting sessions that are relevant to those teaching statistics and
data science. Interested in finding some to view? We highly recommend Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel’s excellent <a href="https://minecr.shinyapps.io/jsm2020-schedule">JSM 2020 Shiny app</a> as an interactive way to explore (see <a href="https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/jsm2020-schedule">here</a> for the source code to this app).</p>

<h2>More info on the blog</h2>
<p>Last summer we wrote a series of blog entries designed to start conversations around teaching data science, <a href="https://teachdatascience.com/">Teach Data Science</a>. We covered topics such as data science software, data ingestation, data technologies, data wrangling, visualization &amp; exploration, communication, and key reports and findings on data science.</p>
<p>One key element that was lacking on our 2019 blog was a discussion about and a commitment to teaching the ethical aspects of data science. We have now found ourselves in the summer of 2020, overwhelmed by the state of the world and re-committed to the ethical challenges which can help data science be a positive force for change.</p>
<p>Although none of us are experts in ethics, we have all included ethics discussions in our classrooms for many years. In the weeks to come, we will share some of the ways we engage our students in these important topics. We will provide resources for readings, examples, datasets, and exercises. We believe that data ethics are part of every data science analysis and classroom experience, and we hope that this summer’s blog will entice you into presenting ethical dilemmas and related conversations to your students early and often.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2020, we plan to write a dozen blog entries. We hope that you bookmark the site and check in regularly. Want a reminder?
