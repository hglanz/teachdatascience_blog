      <description>For the entire week, we’re going to be celebrating using Python for data science education. Stay tuned for topics on specific Python functionality, using Python inside RStudio, Python in the curriculum, and the larger Python community. But before we get to any of those topics, we’re going to start by introducing the go-to interface for Python programming, Jupyter Notebooks.
What is Project Jupyter?Project Jupyter is a non-profit, open-source project, developed in 2014 out of the IPython Project and designed to support interactive data science and scientific computing across multiple programming languages.</description>

      <description>The Importance of Good Coding StyleTo begin with another quote from Hadley Wickham: “Good coding style is like using correct punctuation. You can manage without it, but it sure makes things easier to read.” In this way, coding style is very much an example of a negative virtue. You are much more likely to be told if you have a bad coding style than you are if you have a good coding style.</description>

      <description>What are Projects?RStudio Projects are a mechanism for keeping all the files associated with a project together in one place – data, R scripts, results, figures, reports, etc. Projects are built in to the RStudio IDE, and for good reproducible workflow, all projects should start by creating a Project.
Why RStudio?It goes almost without saying that as a group we have moved completely to the RStudio interface to R.</description>
