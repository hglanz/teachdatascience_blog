      <description>The Importance of Good Coding Style To begin with another quote from Hadley Wickham: “Good coding style is like using correct punctuation. You can manage without it, but it sure makes things easier to read.” In this way, coding style is very much an example of a negative virtue. You are much more likely to be told if you have a bad coding style than you are if you have a good coding style.</description>

      <description>What are Projects? RStudio Projects are a mechanism for keeping all the files associated with a project together in one place – data, R scripts, results, figures, reports, etc. Projects are built in to the RStudio IDE, and for good reproducible workflow, all projects should start by creating a Project.
 Why RStudio? It goes almost without saying that as a group we have moved completely to the RStudio interface to R.</description>
