      <description>The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and MedicineRoundtable on Data Science Postsecondary Education was convened in 2016 to work to develop a coherent vision for the emerging field of data science. The Roundtable, which consists of representatives from industry, government, and academia meets quarterly for a day to discuss best practices, ways to support the growing community, and approaches to help advance data science education.

      <description>The American Statistical Association has placeda priority on how best to teach statistics and data science. The Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) reports have served a key role in guiding instructors and institutions in their pedagogical choices.
Two GAISE reports have been written: one focused on statistics at the PreK-12 level and another, revised in 2016, focused on college level courses. In this GAISE blog entry we focus on the college report.</description>

      <description>Data Science for UndergraduatesAs the first entry in this blog, we thought it would be appropriate to begin with the 2018 consensus report “Data Science for Undergraduates: Opportunities and Options”. Nick was a co-author of this National Academies Report and it provides an accessible overview of undergraduate data science courses and programs. Co-chairs of the committee were Laura Haas (University of Massachusetts/Amherst, https://www.cics.umass.edu/faculty/directory/haas-laura) and Al Hero (University of Michigan, https://hero.</description>
