      <description>What is R Shiny?Straight from RStudio’s wonderful introduction, shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web applications straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. Not only does shiny allow you to build these web apps from R, but it enables their construction using only R code. Knowledge of HTML and web development is not required at all, though it can be used to enhance your apps in numerous ways.</description>
