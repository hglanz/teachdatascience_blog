      <description>It has become increasingly clear that many college students have found themselves without summer plans. Unfortunately, this blog entry is not a list of possible employment opportunities. Instead, it is a compilation of statistics and data science projects to enhance a summer spent socially distant.
The list below represents opportunities at a variety of levels. If you are just beginning or quite advanced, there are many ideas for you.</description>

      <description>We don’t know about you, but at the end of this project we find ourselves rejuvenated, empowered, and somewhat exhausted. In writing ten weeks of daily blog entries, we have learned a tremendous amount in terms of technical skills, pedagogical ideas to try in our fall courses, and ways to connect to the amazing &amp;amp; large data science community.
One of our main goals we set for ourselves this summer was to create a roadmap for faculty development to “ease the learning curve and help busy people incorporate new tools and approaches into their teaching.</description>

      <description>Previous blog entries have discussed cloud based servers (RStudio Server and JupyterHub) and parallel/grid/cluster computing. Today we will expand upon these ideas to discuss at a high level how data science students can leverage cloud based tools to undertake their analyses in a flexible manner.
Our discussion is motivated by several recent papers and blog posts that describe how complex, real-world data science computation can be structured in ways that would not have been feasible in past years without herculean efforts.</description>

      <description>Many of you are likely to have been following the recent news (see here and here and here and here for recent articles) on facial recognition software, its use in the criminal justice system, and the systematic racial biases associated with facial recognition. You may also be aware of other algorithms which are systematically biased against a particular group of people.


However, you may not have a plan for how to bring the ideas into the data science classroom.</description>

      <guid>https://teachdatascience.com/data100/</guid>
      <description>Last week’s entries focused on Python included a description of the innovative and popular data8, today we describe the follow-up course, data100, http://www.ds100.org/ (Principles and Techniques of Data Science) offered by the University of California/Berkeley Division of Data Sciences.


Course GoalsThe goals of data100 are listed on the data100 website and reproduced here. The goals are lofty indeed, but they also address an incredibly important shortcoming in many undergraduate curricula – a student who is successful in data100 will hit the ground running doing data science after graduation.</description>

      <description>All week we’ve been celebrating using Python in data science. There is no question that Python is a fantastic and very powerful language. Additionally, it is typically thought of as clearly the most used language for doing data science. The kaggle 2017 survey reports that more than three-quarters of data scientists use Python (although they also mention that most statisticians use R).


Knowing how to use Python is an important first step to engaging with the software.</description>

      <description>As part of our week of Python, we wanted to focus on innovative pedagogical approaches that have been used to scale outreach efforts. A great example is the http://Data8.org (Foundations of Data Science) course that has been offered by the University of California/Berkeley Division of Data Sciences.
The course combines three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. Students are asked to use real data to understand relationships and patterns while teaching critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference.</description>

      <description>Today we have a guest entry authored by Tim Erickson (eeps media) and Bill Finzer (Concord Consortium) about the use of the Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP) to teach data science. They write:
We’ve been designing point-and-click data software since the early 90’s. From the beginning, though, we wanted to get beyond point-and-click to a user experience of data immersion. (William Gibson’s 1984 cyberpunk novel Neuromancer and its “cyberspace” both inspired and eluded us.</description>

      <description>Image credit: xkcd.comStatistics for scienceFiguring out truth is really hard to do. Teaching students how to attempt it may be even harder. As statisticians we know that statistical significance isn’t truth, but we still hope that the process by which we analyze data will lead us on a path toward scientific discovery. How do we teach students the best way to stay on the path of using statistics to move science forward?</description>

      <description>Throughout the summer 2019 blog series, we have given teaching tips, best data science practices, links to compilations of papers in data science and in teaching data science, and ways to participate in the larger data science community. That is, for anyone already working in a data science community (e.g., in a job or an academic institution) or for anyone doing data science for fun, we have provided myriad rabbit holes in which to get lost for your entire summer.</description>

      <description>As educators, it is exciting that our course enrollments are up and students are excited about data science topics, models, software, and careers. It is also validating that when they graduate, our students are able to support themselves doing interesting and engaging work. However, it can be sometimes disheartening to realize how many of our data science students use their skills to maximize the number of times viewers click on ads.</description>

      <description>When people ask about how to get their students engaged with R in their introductory statistics and data science courses we offer three pieces of advice:
keep it simple (discussed in the “Less Volume, More Creativity” blog entry)engage students to provide peer-tutoring and drop-in office hours to assist with questions and coding to complement class and office hours (at Amherst College this is coordinated by the Statistics and Data Science Fellows)have students use a dedicated server to access RSlide credit: Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel</description>

      <description>Pair programming is a technique from software development where two programmers work in tandem to code. One is designated the driver, responsible for typing, while the other, often called the navigator or observer reviews the code and provides a high-level overview of the task.

Pair programming has been thought to lead to better code, more enjoyable coding, andhigher productivity, with some research findings supporting those conclusions (see some of the references at the end of this entry).</description>

      <description>Although an agreed upon definition of data science is hard to come by, there is clear consensus that statistics plays a key role in the foundational knowledge of anyone working with data. One important aspect of statistics is understanding of the inferential process that allows claims to be made about a population from a dataset. Most Introductory Statistics courses and textbooks spend substantial time presenting statistical inference as a way to generate p-values and make claims (or not) about a research hypothesis.</description>

      <description>GitHub ClassroomIf you have been reading along in the blog, you’ve noticed the last two entries describing GitHub and GitHub in R. And certainly, we continue to advocate teaching students to use GitHub as an integral part of their data science workflow. And GitHub may be the perfect place to store student projects either as public or private repositories.
But using GitHub to navigate a dozen homework assignments with 50 students can become logistically difficult.</description>

      <description>Calls for DiversityData science is made up of not only sets of tools, methods, and problems to solve, but also actual people who make up the statistics &amp;amp; data science community. The National Academies Report on Data Science for Undergraduates (see previous blog post at: https://teachdatascience.com/nasem) includes a section on “Ensuring Broad Participation” which reiterates the importance of creating an inclusive community where all views are heard and supported.</description>

      <description>Why another Data Science Education blog?This is an exciting time to be teaching students how to extract meaning from data. Amidst the flood of information available in almost all domains there have been a flourishing of powerful, open-source tools to help with the process. For instructors, the many changes can be hard to keep up with. In this blog, we’re hoping to create a roadmap for faculty development that will ease the learning curve and help busy people incorporate new tools and approaches into their teaching.</description>
