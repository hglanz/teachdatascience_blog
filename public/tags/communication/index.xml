      <description>As statistics educators, it is often easier to focus our teaching on methods instead of communication. And while many of us understand the value of good communication, actually teaching it is difficult and outside of our comfort zone. There has been quite a bit of work done on the science of visualization (e.g., the Grammar of Graphics by Wilkinson). There is general consensus that teaching students to communicate using visualizations is of paramount importance (see recent blog entries: National Academies Report on Data Science and GAISE).</description>

      <description>What is R Markdown?Straight from RStudioâ€™s wonderful tutorial, R Markdown is an authoring framework for data science. An R Markdown file is a plain text file with three types of content: code chunks to run, text to display, and metadata to help govern the R Markdown build process. Put simply, R Markdown is an exciting new reporting medium that seamlessly integrates executable code and expository text.
By including data work, code, and analysis narrative into a single document, R Markdown provides a fully reproducible vehicle for data science projects!</description>
