      <description>Previous blog entries have discussed cloud based servers (RStudio Server and JupyterHub) and parallel/grid/cluster computing. Today we will expand upon these ideas to discuss at a high level how data science students can leverage cloud based tools to undertake their analyses in a flexible manner.
Our discussion is motivated by several recent papers and blog posts that describe how complex, real-world data science computation can be structured in ways that would not have been feasible in past years without herculean efforts.</description>

      <description>The NASEM Data Science for Undergraduates report noted that the storage, preparation, and accessing of data is at the heart of data science and that students need to directly experience multiple forms of data, including the use of databases.
SQL (pronounced sequel) stands for Structured Query Language; it is a language designed to manage data in a relational database system. The papers https://chance.amstat.org/2015/04/setting-the-stage and https://chance.amstat.org/2015/04/databases/ provide a high level overview of database systems.</description>
