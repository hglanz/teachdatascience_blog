      <description>Today’s guest entry by Kelly McConville (Reed College) describes the creation of data packages in R by instructors and students.
Sharing data with studentsThe beginning of the data analysis cycle involves ingesting data. For novice students in the first week or two of an introductory course, this can be a tricky step. If I am new to R and I can’t even load the data, then my first impressions of R are not going to be too great.</description>

      <description>Leaflet for mappingMaps are an important way of displaying data.
The leaflet package in R provides access to the Leaflet Javascript libraries (http://leafletjs.com), an open-source mechanism to create interactive maps. The leaflet package (https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) provides an interface within R that allows for composing maps using map tiles (e.g., from OpenStreetMap, https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/38.007/-95.844) that can be annotated with markers, lines, popups.
Here’s a simple example where data from higher education institutions from within the Five College Consortium in Western Massachusetts is mapped.</description>
