      <description>As we near the end of our summer posts, we’ve started to think more broadly about statistics as well as data science courses. Today’s post considers a broad question relevant for many courses: how can we teach statistical thinking without having to resort to introducing a profusion of tests?
Jonas Kristoffer Lindeløv proposed an elegant approach using the idea that common statistical tests are linear models.</description>

      <description>In 2016, GAISE enunciated the importance of multivariate thinking and technology when teaching introductory statistics and data science courses. A big challenge is how to do this using R and RStudio without running into cognitive overload with our students.
The mosaic package was created by Randall Pruim, Danny Kaplan, and Nicholas Horton with the goal of introducing a Less Volume, More Creativity approach to introductory statistics that could simplify the use of technology.</description>
