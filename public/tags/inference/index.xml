      <description>As we near the end of our summer posts, we’ve started to think more broadly about statistics as well as data science courses. Today’s post considers a broad question relevant for many courses: how can we teach statistical thinking without having to resort to introducing a profusion of tests?
Jonas Kristoffer Lindeløv proposed an elegant approach using the idea that common statistical tests are linear models.</description>

      <description>Image credit: xkcd.comStatistics for scienceFiguring out truth is really hard to do. Teaching students how to attempt it may be even harder. As statisticians we know that statistical significance isn’t truth, but we still hope that the process by which we analyze data will lead us on a path toward scientific discovery. How do we teach students the best way to stay on the path of using statistics to move science forward?</description>

      <description>Although an agreed upon definition of data science is hard to come by, there is clear consensus that statistics plays a key role in the foundational knowledge of anyone working with data. One important aspect of statistics is understanding of the inferential process that allows claims to be made about a population from a dataset. Most Introductory Statistics courses and textbooks spend substantial time presenting statistical inference as a way to generate p-values and make claims (or not) about a research hypothesis.</description>
