      <description>Shiny RecapYesterday we introduced R Shiny and discussed how it allows you to build interactive web applications straight from R. We saw a few examples highlighting the wondrous interactivity of exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and data models that it enables. If you didn’t catch yesterday’s post, check it out at https://teachdatascience.com/shiny1/ and be sure to go play around with some Shiny apps at RStudio’s gallery at https://shiny.</description>

      <description>What is R Shiny?Straight from RStudio’s wonderful introduction, shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web applications straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. Not only does shiny allow you to build these web apps from R, but it enables their construction using only R code. Knowledge of HTML and web development is not required at all, though it can be used to enhance your apps in numerous ways.</description>
