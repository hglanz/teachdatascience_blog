      <description>Previous blog entries have discussed cloud based servers (RStudio Server and JupyterHub) and parallel/grid/cluster computing. Today we will expand upon these ideas to discuss at a high level how data science students can leverage cloud based tools to undertake their analyses in a flexible manner.
Our discussion is motivated by several recent papers and blog posts that describe how complex, real-world data science computation can be structured in ways that would not have been feasible in past years without herculean efforts.</description>
